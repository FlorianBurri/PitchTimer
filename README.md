# Pitch Timer

A perfect pitch needs careful planning and execution.  
Pitch Timer helps you make the best use of the limited time available by letting you lay out and time the chapters beforehand.

During your pitch, Pitch Timer will guide you, letting you know how much time you have left for each chapter so that you can stay on track and deliver your message effectively.
